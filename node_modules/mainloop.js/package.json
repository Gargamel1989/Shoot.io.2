In games, it is typically responsible for computing physics and AI as\nwell as drawing the result on the screen.\n\nMain loops are\n[difficult to write correctly](http://www.isaacsukin.com/news/2015/01/detailed-explanation-javascript-game-loops-and-timing)\ndue to timing issues. **The vast majority of main loops found online are\nwritten incorrectly**, resulting in applications that speed up or slow down\ndepending on the frame rate. This can cause unfortunate behavior like\ncharacters running through walls or being unable to jump over obstacles. These\nmain loops can also result in applications that are non-deterministic. This\nproject solves these problems.\n\n## Get started\n\n - **[Example](http://icecreamyou.github.com/MainLoop.js/demo/)**\n   ([source code](https://github.com/IceCreamYou/MainLoop.js/blob/gh-pages/demo/index.html))\n - **[API documentation](http://icecreamyou.github.com/MainLoop.js/docs/#!/api/MainLoop)**\n - **[MainLoop.js source code](https://github.com/IceCreamYou/MainLoop.js/blob/gh-pages/src/mainloop.js)**\n   (heavily documented to explain how it works - the source is about 75% docs)\n - **[How it works](http://www.isaacsukin.com/news/2015/01/detailed-explanation-javascript-game-loops-and-timing)**\n   and a detailed walkthrough of what problems this project solves\n\n### Installation\n\nYou can download the script normally, install it with Bower (`bower install\nMainLoop`), or install it with npm (`npm install mainloop.js`). To include it\non a page client-side without a module loader:\n\n```html\n<!-- from a direct download or git clone -->\n<script src=\"build/mainloop.min.js\"></script>\n\n<!-- from Bower -->\n<script src=\"bower_components/mainloop.js/build/mainloop.min.js\"></script>\n\n<!-- from npm -->\n<script src=\"node_modules/mainloop.js/build/mainloop.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\nYou then have access to the `MainLoop` global.\n\nMainLoop.js is also compatible with CommonJS (e.g. with node.js, io.js, or\nbrowserify) and AMD (e.g. with RequireJS). This means that if you are using\na module loader or want to use MainLoop server-side you can call\n`require('mainloop')` to get the `MainLoop` object or include `'mainloop'` in\nthe dependencies you pass to a `define()` call.\n\n### Usage\n\n`MainLoop` works by running functions you define every time the browser is\nready to update the screen (up to about 60 times per second on most monitors).\nThere are four such functions, all of which are optional. You can set them\nusing the following methods:\n\n - `MainLoop.setBegin()`: the `begin` function runs at the beginning of each\n   frame and is typically used to process input.\n - `MainLoop.setUpdate()`: the `update` function runs zero or more times per\n   frame depending on the frame rate. It is used to compute anything affected\n   by time - typically physics and AI movements.\n - `MainLoop.setDraw()`: the `draw` function should update the screen, usually\n   by changing the DOM or painting a canvas.\n - `MainLoop.setEnd()`: the `end` function runs at the end of each frame and is\n   typically used for cleanup tasks such as adjusting the visual quality based\n   on the frame rate.\n\nThe `update` function receives a `delta` parameter which holds the amount of\ntime in milliseconds that should be simulated. This should be used to calculate\nmovement. For example, if an object `obj` has an x-axis velocity of 100 units\nper second (0.1 units per millisecond), the `update` function might look like\nthis:\n\n```javascript\nfunction update(delta) {\n    obj.x += 0.1 * delta;\n}\n```\n\nThis structure will ensure that your application behaves regardless of the\nframe rate.\n\nTo start the application, simply call `MainLoop.start()`. For example, to start\nthe application for the first time, you might write:\n\n```javascript\nMainLoop.setUpdate(update).setDraw(draw).start();\n```\n\nYou can call `MainLoop.stop()` to stop the application.\n\nFor more detail about the API, check out the\n[documentation](http://icecreamyou.github.com/MainLoop.js/docs/#!/api/MainLoop).\nYou can also check out a\n[usage example](http://icecreamyou.github.com/MainLoop.js/demo/)\n([source code](https://github.com/IceCreamYou/MainLoop.js/blob/gh-pages/demo/index.html)).\n\n## Notes\n\nThis project is\n[MIT-licensed](https://github.com/IceCreamYou/MainLoop.js/blob/gh-pages/LICENSE.txt).\n\nCompatible with all modern browsers (IE9+) including mobile browsers, as well\nas node.js and io.js. There are no dependencies.\n\nContributions are welcome. To get started contributing, run `npm install` in\nthe project's directory, then run `grunt` before submitting a pull request to\nupdate the minified script and the docs as well as to perform a style check.\n\n[Isaac Sukin](http://www.isaacsukin.com/)\n([@IceCreamYou](https://twitter.com/IceCreamYou)) is the author of this\nproject. I'd love to hear about what you make!
